<h1> The background Property </h1>
<p> The background property is a shorthand property for specifying all the background properties in one declaration. </p>
<p> Here, the background image is only shown once, and it is also positioned in the top-right corner. </p>
<p> We have also added a right margin, so that the text will not write over the background image. </p>
